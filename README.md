# Exploratory Data Analysis of Global Terrorism Database (GTD)

**Introduction**

The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is a vital resource used by researchers, analysts, policy-makers, and students worldwide to study and understand the complex landscape of global terrorism. In my project, I aim to conduct an intensive analysis of the GTD, with the primary objective of gaining a deeper insight into the causes and consequences of terrorism. By leveraging historical data spanning from 1970 to 2017, encompassing information on over 200,000 terrorist attacks, I seek to shed light on the strengths and limitations of current security measures and foster a better understanding of the global terrorism phenomenon.

**Approach**

To accomplish my objectives, I followed a comprehensive approach that included the following steps:

**Data Preprocessing**

Data preprocessing is a fundamental step to ensure the quality and reliability of my analysis. This included:

**Understanding the Data:** 
I started by getting familiar with the dataset and its structure, examining the column names and data types to determine the initial state of the data.

**Handling Null and Missing Values:** 
Null values can affect the accuracy of my analysis. I checked for missing data and implemented strategies to handle null values, such as dropping or imputing based on the specific situation.

**Understanding Statistical Info:** 
To gain a deeper understanding of the data, I calculated and analyzed various statistical measures, such as mean, median, and standard deviation. This allowed me to identify central tendencies and variations within the dataset.

**Checking for Outliers:** 
Identifying and dealing with outliers is essential to maintain data integrity. I conducted an outlier analysis to understand the presence of extreme values and took appropriate actions to address them.

**Feature Selection**
After data preprocessing, I focused on feature selection to identify the most relevant variables for my analysis. This ensured that my exploration was concentrated on the most informative features.

##**Insights Explored**
The insights explored throughout my project include:


**Countries Most Affected by Terrorism**
By utilizing bar graphs, I identified and visualized the countries most affected by terrorism. This information can have significant implications for nations and security agencies, helping them fortify their borders and improve internal security. Enhanced understanding and cooperation between neighboring countries can contribute to the reduction of cross-border terrorism.

**Birth and Growth of Boko Haram in Nigeria**
I conducted a detailed analysis of the emergence and growth of Boko Haram in Nigeria, shedding light on the evolution of this notorious terrorist group

**Efforts to Reduce Naxalism**
My exploration extended to the efforts made by the Jharkhand government to combat naxalism in their region. I showcased the initiatives aimed at reducing insurgency.

**Loss of Human Lives Over the Years**

I analyzed the loss of human lives due to terrorism over the years, allowing me to make a comparison between the threat posed by terrorism in the Eastern and Western hemispheres.

**Success Rates of Terrorist Organizations**

A comprehensive analysis was conducted to assess the success rates of major terror outfits, providing insights into the effectiveness of their operations and identifying organizations with the highest success rates.

**Terrorism in India - Targeted Cities**

I focused on India, a nation prone to terror attacks, to identify the cities that have been primary targets of terrorists. A region-wise count of these attacks was portrayed.


##**Technical Approach**

My analysis was primarily conducted using Python, and a variety of charts were employed to understand the patterns and insights of terrorist attacks worldwide. The technical approach involved data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis to draw meaningful conclusions.


##**Conclusion**

In conclusion, my project delved into a critical analysis of the Global Terrorism Database, **spanning a wide range of insights related to the causes and consequences of terrorism**. Through **data preprocessing, chart-based exploration, feature selection, and a technical approach that harnessed the power of Python**, I gained valuable insights into the world of global terrorism. The results offer potential improvements in security strategies and international cooperation, while also emphasizing the significance of understanding the evolution of terrorist organizations and the targeted regions. By conducting this exploratory data analysis, I hope to contribute to a better-informed approach in the ongoing battle against terrorism globally.
